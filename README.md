# fosid.live
Developed the website fosid.live with my team for Science Industry Day 2024, an event organized by the Faculty of Science at the University of Peradeniya. This platform facilitated connections between students and leading companies in Sri Lanka, supporting career and internship opportunities.

This platform was designed for event management with user registration, queue management, room management and so much more.
